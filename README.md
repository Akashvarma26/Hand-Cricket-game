# Odd-Even-Cricket-game    
This is popular game that we used to play in school during the breaks.    
I have used python as my programming language and also used random library   
that will help in generating the numbers. This code will work in Player vs  
computer game in which computer will be randomly generating values and player   
(user) will be choosing numbers to win against the computer.    
     
The rules to play this game are:-   
1) player will have to enter number between 1 and 6.    
      
NOTE:- The code does not has any functions but will have comments for understanding.    
      
Hope you will have fun trying the game by yourself.
